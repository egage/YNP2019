1. Shoots on stems

2. Stems on plants  

3. plants within sites

## Site Measurements

1. Water table elevation via manual measurements of wells and staff gauges  

2. Water level elevation through use of continuous dataloggers (pressure transducers) 

3. Soil temperature using continuous dataloggers [add where, using what]  

4. Meteorological data [add what was collected, where and when]

5. Survey data [add survey data collected when and by whom]

6. Remote sensing and GIS analyses
